Disclaimer: I used Perplexity for summerize the titles or description in this readme.
In this repo I have 2 main files. One of them is a registry file that needs to open as administrator and also as the current user. the second file is a powershell for debloating some programs and needs to run as admin. 

I've seperated what each file does in this readme. while the first part is for the reg file, and the second part will include the script.

-REGISTRY FILE:-
----------------

-----Performance & Memory-----
*	Increases the icon cache size so Explorer renders icons faster without re-loading them

*	Keeps the memory manager optimized for desktop app use rather than server-style file caching
*	Disables Superfetch and Prefetcher, preventing Windows from pre-loading apps into RAM in the background
